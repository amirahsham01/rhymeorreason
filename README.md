### Overview:
A digital poetry book where users can share poetry, gather literary ideas and inspiration on an online platform. Users can read through the existing archive of poems or hone their writing skills and showcase their own verses.

### Objectives:
- Register and Login for User
- CRUD Poem and Chapter Model
- Routes for User, Dashboard, Poem and Chapter

### Technologies used:
- MongoDB
- Node.js / Express.js
- Bootstrap / MDBootstrap
- Jquery

### Approach taken:
- Users, whether registered on the app or not are able to freely browse through poems uploaded by others
- If they decide to join the community of writers, they are able to register as a member on the app
- Once registered, users can access their profile information on their dashboard page
- View and populate lists of saved poems
- Add in chapters to the database to categorize topics of poetry
- Add in personal or other authors' poetry


### Further
- Unsolved Problems
    - Being able to edit one's uploaded poems instead of other users' works
    - Being able to update and edit user profile such as status, avatar and personal information
    - Option to save drafts instead of instantly publishing it
- Additional Features
    - Include in Search functionality to look for poems or authors
    - Option to display your works as private or public
    - Implement Socket.io to interact and connect with other users and authors in realtime
